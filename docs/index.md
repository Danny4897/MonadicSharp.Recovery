features:
  - icon: 🔄
    title: RescueAsync
    details: One-shot recovery. When a specific error occurs, attempt a single corrective action and merge back to the green track. If recovery fails, stay on the red track.

  - icon: 🔁
    title: StartFixBranchAsync
    details: Multi-attempt recovery with configurable delay. Try up to N times before giving up — each attempt is logged, delayable, and can target specific error predicates.

  - icon: 🛣️
    title: The Three Lanes
    details: Green (success), Amber (recovery), Red (failure). Recovery.Amber is a first-class lane — not an exception handler bolted on top.

  - icon: 📡
    title: Recovery Telemetry
    details: Implement IRecoveryTelemetry to receive structured events for every recovery attempt — start, success, failure, and exhaustion. Integrates with OpenTelemetry.

  - icon: 🎯
    title: Error Predicates
    details: Target only the errors that should trigger recovery. Predicates compose — match by type, code, severity, or any custom condition. Other errors pass through unchanged.

  - icon: 🔗
    title: Composable
    details: Recovery operators chain naturally with MonadicSharp Bind/Map. No wrapping, no unwrapping — the amber track is transparent to the rest of your pipeline.
